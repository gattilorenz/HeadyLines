(I can't get no) satisfaction
A hard day's night
A little less conversation
A tale of two cities
A whiter shade of pale
All you need is love
Anarchy in the UK
Another brick in the wall
Another one bites the dust
Are you lonesome tonight?
Baby one more time
Back to the future
Blowing in the wind
Born on the fourth of July
Boulevard of broken dreams
Bridge over troubled water
Call me maybe
Can you feel the love tonight
Crazy little thing called love
Crime and punishment
Diamonds are forever
Every breath you take
Everybody needs somebody to love
Eye of the tiger
Fifty shades of grey
For whom the bell tolls
Georgia on my mind
Girl with a pearl earring
God save the queen
Gone with the wind
Happiness is a warm gun
Here comes the sun
House of the rising sun
How deep is your love
How to train your dragon
I can't buy me love
I can't help falling in love
I can't stop loving you
I saw her standing there
I want it that way
I want to break free
I want to hold your hand
I will survive
In search of lost time
It must have been love
Killing me softly
Knocking on heaven's door
Light my fire
Like a rolling stone
Live and let die
Living on a prayer
Losing my religion
Love me tender
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Magical mystery tour
Money for nothing
My heart will go on
No woman no cry
Nothing compares to you
One flew over the cuckoo's nest
One hundred years of solitude
Pride and prejudice
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
Rock around the clock
Saving private Ryan
Sgt. Pepper's lonely hearts club band
Shine on you crazy diamond
Slippery when wet
Smells like teen spirit
Snow white and the seven dwarfs
Somebody that I used to know
Somewhere over the rainbow
Son of a preacher man
Stairway to heaven
Stand by me
Strawberry fields forever
Sweet child of mine
Sweet dreams (are made of this)
Sympathy for the devil
The catcher in the rye
The dark knight rises
The dark side of the moon
The empire strikes back
The grapes of wrath
The hunchback of Notre Dame
The long and winding road
The lord of the rings
The men who stare at goats
The nightmare before Christmas
The number of the beast
The prince and the pauper
The show must go on
The spy who shagged me
The unexpected virtue of ignorance
The wolf of Wall Street
There's something about Mary
Three men in a boat
Through the looking glass
Too much love will kill you
Total eclipse of the heart
We are never ever getting back together
We are the champions
We can work it out
We will rock you
What happens in Vegas
What to expect when you're expecting
What's my age again
When Harry met Sally
When the saints go marching in
While my guitar gently weeps
Who framed roger rabbit
Wind of change
Wish you were here
With a little help from my friends
You've lost that loving feeling
